              Support is urgently needed for those injured during the Quota
              Movement protests, where many students and activists were harmed
              advocating for fair reforms in Bangladesh. Your aid can provide

              to help the injured recover and rebuild their lives. These brave
              individuals stood for justice and equality, and now they need our
              help. By contributing, you can make a tangible difference in their
              recovery process. Stand with them today and show solidarity in
              their fight for a just cause.
